## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

This project is an invaders game that runs directly on the terminal. The invaders will move along the screen and try to attack your spaceship and you will have to shoot them
until they all explode.


## WHAT IS THE TECH STACK

This is the cool part. It is all written with RUST a new Language to me and possibly my new favourite. 
In this project, many of the fundamental Rust concepts are implemented. To name some:
 - Scalar and Compound types
 - Control Flow
 - Ownership and References and Borrowing
 - Structs and Traits
 - Threats and closures
 - Enums


## HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT
It is straightforward to run this project. First Clone the project on your device. Then ensure you have RUST installed:

for Windows users:
- https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- OR run ```choco install rust```

for MAC users:
- ```brew install rust```

After Rust is successfully installed on your device, open the terminal and navigate to the directory of the file. Then run the command ```cargo run```.


## FINAL NOTE
I hope you enjoy playing this classic game.
